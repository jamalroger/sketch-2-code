        Generating HTML Code from a hand-drawn wireframe

        <img class="card-img-top" src="/static/sketchcode.png" alt="Card image cap">
        SketchCode is a deep learning model that takes hand-drawn web mockups and converts them into working HTML code. It uses an image captioning architecture to generate its HTML markup from hand-drawn website wireframes.
        
        For more information, check out this post: Automating front-end development with deep learning
        
        This project builds on the synthetically generated dataset and model architecture from pix2code by Tony Beltramelli and the Design Mockups project from Emil Wallner.

        Note: This project is meant as a proof-of-concept; the model isn't (yet) built to generalize to the variability of sketches seen in actual wireframes, and thus its performance relies on wireframes resembling the core dataset.
